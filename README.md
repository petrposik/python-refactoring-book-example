# python-refactoring-book-example
The first motivational example from Martin Fowler's Refactoring book, second edition, in Python.

## Description
From the book:

> Imagine a company of theatrical players who go out to various events performing plays. Typically, a customer will request a few plays and the company charges them based on the size of the audience and the kind of play they perform. There are currently two kinds of plays that the company performs: tragedies and comedies. As well as providing a bill for the performance, the company gives its customers “volume credits” which they can use for discounts on future performances.

The data about their plays is stored in a plain JSON file (`plays.json`), the data for their bills also comes in JSON file (`invoices.json`).
